Dots
==================

Sprinkles dots of random sizes and hues around your artboard using a ‘multiply’ blending mode. It’s my first plugin for [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/). Sketch plugins are written in CocoaScript which is basically JavaScript with access to Cocoa frameworks and a splash of that sassy Objective C bracket syntax.
